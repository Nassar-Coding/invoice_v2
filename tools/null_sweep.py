"""X8 (G3 correction round 3): every input G2 can leave empty or unresolved, through both engines and the batch.

The field inventory is G2's own, never a hand list: every column of the four claim files (audit.claims.FILES), every key
of the civil record layout and of the drilling report (spec/evidence_cw.yaml, spec/evidence_dds.yaml), whole report
parts and part headings, keys written twice, and list entries G2 cannot recognise (tool terms, crew entries, days
worked). Evidence documents are mutated as TEXT and re-parsed by the real G2 parsers, so every empty value and every
queue entry is exactly what G2 would hand over; a mutation after which G2 holds an ordinary value (a garbled free-text
'Well: ??' that G2 accepts as a well name) is out of scope and counted as such. Claim fields are emptied as the G2
loader leaves them: typed fields None, text fields blank ('') or None (a short CSV row); the join key also as a header
G2 does not have.

Sample: in every civil and drilling code family of spec/g3_code_families.yaml, the first line of every billed code
(line_ref order), plus the first line showing each input-sensitive feature (night work, each zone, rest day, a
protected submission, a record, each status and hole section, a protected invoice) and each thing the output stage's
decision scopes select on (each finding, alternative dimension, question reading and amount status); a family with no
billed line (codes outside Schedule 1) gets a line built from a real one with its code replaced. For each (line, input, empty value):
  1. an explicit result - no exception and never an engine_error;
  2. no silent default - where the input matters to this line's value (an admissible other value of it changes the
     value: the relevance probe; for an unrecognised list entry, each recognised entry), the result names the input and
     either leaves the value unresolved, or carries every value the input could take (alternatives covering the line
     as billed and each probe), or is not payable by the contract's own rule for that input (REGISTERED);
  3. nothing lost - where the input does not matter to the value, the value is unchanged;
  4. the batch - the production run() over a sub-world holding every sample line, with the input emptied on all of
     them (claim field, header field or document), completes, gives every line a result, no engine_error, and each
     result equals the direct evaluation of the same inputs; the line reference is also emptied (G2 then identifies
     the line by its source position) and repeated between lines (no line's result may replace another's);
  5. the output stage - audit.g3_run's summary, decision scopes and trace sample over each batch's results, with the
     other contract's sample lines alongside, completes; the summary counts every line once by status and compares no
     rate for a line with no value at G3; and a decision scope that reaches such a line lists it as not valued rather
     than counting it (its line count falls when those lines are removed, so it must list at least as many);
  6. coverage - every claim field (line and header) is emptied on at least one line of every code family.
