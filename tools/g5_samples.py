"""G5 independent-outcome sample: inputs only (plan §2 G5 exit: 'independently reviewed complete invoices reconcile
step by step').

A sample of complete invoices of both contracts, chosen from the RAW pinned data only (a seeded random draw, plus
invoices picked for raw features a reader can see without any engine: header arithmetic that does not reconcile,
submission dates outside the window, the same item/area/date or well/day/service billed twice, the documents submitted
around the A3 dates of issue and after the civil completion). Each packet gives the reader the invoice as billed, every
record or report its lines cite, and the raw context the cross-invoice checks need (other invoices' lines for the same
measurement or well-day, the well's report dates and runs, the submission dates around an A3 issue), plus the adopted
G5 decisions as stated premises (they are the owner's and the register's decisions, not results). Written BEFORE any
G5 code; readers (prompts/phase3/g5_expected_outcomes_v1.md) compute the expected outcome of each invoice from the
contract scans alone.

Usage::  python tools/g5_samples.py      (writes verification/g5/samples/packet_cw_*.jsonl, packet_dds_*.jsonl, meta.yaml)
