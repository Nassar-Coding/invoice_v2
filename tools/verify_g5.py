"""G5 exit checks (plan §2, G5): full invoice outcomes.

Exit condition: "Every invoice has check coverage, findings, amount status and an evidence trail; monetary and procedural
outcomes remain distinct; independently reviewed complete invoices reconcile step by step." Checks:

  Z1 one outcome per template invoice: exactly the 2,806 template ids, each once; submission.csv has the six template
     columns in template order, binary flags, a category exactly when flagged, integer minor units, billed cents equal
     to 100 x the judged header field (application_total / invoice_total), confidence in [0, 1].
  Z2 check coverage: every invoice has a recorded status for each of the twelve checks, and its lines are exactly the
     claim lines that carry its number (every line through G3 and G4).
  Z3 findings and evidence trail: a flagged invoice names at least one established finding with its line or header, its
     category is exactly the root categories of those findings (every finding code mapped); an unflagged invoice has no
     finding under any scenario.
  Z4 monetary and procedural outcomes distinct: a flag resting only on procedural or payment-only findings keeps the
     contract value as its expected total (no blanket zero); billing is never authority - changing every billed amount
     and header total changes no contract total, and a flagged row exports the contract total; the invoice's statement of
     an unsupplied fact is never authority (G5-B01) - changing every stated class and unrecorded ground changes no flag,
     category, exported total, contract total or confidence.
  Z5 independent sample: every reader's flag and expected total agree with the engine or carry a live settlement
     (verification/g5/sample_dispositions.yaml); the comparison reproduces; packets committed before the readers'
     outputs and both before the G5 engine (git).
  Z6 reconciliation step by step (and G5-B04: the legal combinations, joined line by line without the engine's list of
     open dimensions, give exactly its formed totals): every expected total is recomputed from the outcome's line values (civil:
     their sum; drilling: services, DS-900 = -4% of the excess over 250,000, net, VAT 15%, total, rounding half-even with
     exact rational arithmetic) and every cents figure from its decimal.
  Z7 ambiguity rule: flag = 0 only when the invoice is correct under every scenario; a flag where scenarios disagree has
     confidence 0.50; the confidence follows the rubric (Q9-5) in every band; no row above 0.80 depends on an unsupplied
     fact.
  Z8 decisions and registers: every spec/g5_decisions.yaml entry has a computed effect; no question still blocks G5; every
     question G5 owned carries a g5_disposition; the owner's decisions are recorded as the owner's.
  Z9 reproduction and boundary: the committed verification/g5 outputs reproduce; G3 results and G4 state are unchanged by
     G5.
