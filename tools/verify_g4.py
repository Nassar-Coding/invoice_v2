"""G4 exit checks (plan §2, G4): chronology and shared state.

Exit condition: "Small multi-invoice histories agree with independent expected events and amounts; ordering, reset,
allocation and replay tests pass; no duplicate event or adjustment is counted twice." Checks:

  Y1 histories: every line, adjustment and retention figure of every history agrees with each isolated reader, or the
     disagreement carries a settlement (verification/g4/history_dispositions.yaml) that is still live; the committed
     comparison reproduces; the packets were committed before the readers' outputs and both before the G4 engines (git).
  Y2 ordering: the claim rows of both contracts in reverse order, and in a seeded shuffle, give identical G4 values,
     alternatives and state checks (no incidental row order decides a state outcome); the civil band ledgers count in
     execution-date order (never application or submission order), and every order of a same-date group that changes
     a division is carried.
  Y3 resets: every civil ledger starts at zero in its Contract Year (CY2 under Q12 A begins on 2026-01-05, Q12 B has no
     CY2); every entry's count before it is the sum of the counts before it in the ledger; every drilling footage
     accumulator starts at zero per well and Contract Year (Q14 A: 1 January 2026) and adds each charged interval once.
  Y4 allocation: every duplicate / once-only group leaves exactly one charge standing under every alternative, never a
     charge off its contractual day; every PD-210 well-day carries the complete joint allocation domain over its interval
     coverage (one scenario per assignment of each contested segment to one covering charge) and under every scenario
     the kept metres sum to the union of the day's intervals, each charge within its own interval (G4-B02); a daily limit binds the quantity that stands; the A3 difference of every protected
     line is posted on exactly one document per reading (a same-day tie stays open, never posted twice); the 45A
     release is posted once.
  Y5 replay: a second run gives identical results (determinism); a correction to an early measurement (the first line
     of a band ledger removed) replays every later entry of that ledger and nothing else, and the replayed ledger
     equals an independent recount; on the histories, removing a document and rerunning gives the same result as a
     packet built without it.
  Y6 exactly once: no measurement, charge, adjustment, deduction or release is counted twice: at most one standing
     measurement per civil item/area/date or week under every alternative; each band line once per ledger; each A3
     line once in its account and its own value left at the protected figure; no P23 deduction posted beside a line
     already excluded (Q3 A); retention released once.
  Y7 traces: every value G4 changed (and every alternative) replays with independent arithmetic
     (tools/verify_g3.replay), ends at the line's quantity and amount and cites a source on every step.
  Y8 boundary and reproduction: G3 results are unchanged by G4 (G4 works on copies); every G3 'g4_dependency' is
     answered by a G4 state check; the committed verification/g4 outputs reproduce; the G4 modules contain no G5+
     construct (classification, flag, invoice total, submission).
  Y9 registers: every entry of spec/g4_decisions.yaml has a basis with pages, histories that exist, and a computed
     scope; every question G4 owned (originally_blocks G4) is decided or carries a g4_disposition and a later owner;
     no question or carried item still blocks G4.
