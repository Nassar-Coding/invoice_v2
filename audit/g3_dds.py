"""G3 drilling (DDS-2025-118): local entitlement and pricing of one invoice line.

Line-level checks (plan §5 checks 1-8, local part): identity, term, submission window, period, unit (Cl.35; remedy is
Q11), report evidence (the quoted Daily Drilling Report for the well and day, signatures, the Schedule 5 part: Cl.37),
status and section as recorded (Cl.19, R7), quantities by service family (persons Cl.22, coordinator Q5, tool days
Cl.28, hours Cl.21/21A/P10 with Q4 alternatives, counts Cl.30, metres Cl.23-25/25A, run events Cl.26, well events
Cl.27, loss Cl.31/31A/P12), rate version by service date (instruments in issue order; 36A protection of invoices
submitted before a retrospective amendment's issue; D2), indexation (17A), build-up section -> class -> standby ->
S2/A2 discount (Cl.18, 17B) with half-even rounding at every step (Cl.17), and line arithmetic.

Not decided here (G4/G5): daily limits, duplicates, once-per-run and once-per-well counting, the A3 adjustment
posting, the DS-900 discount, VAT and totals. They are listed as g4_dependencies (or deferred for DS-900).

G3 correction round: the well class is the call-off's (Cl.4; P2, P3) and no call-off is supplied, so a class-rated
service is priced under every class (the invoice header's class is disclosed as the contractor's statement); PD-210's
allowed metres, parts and amount agree under 25A (a tolerance difference on a charge crossing a band edge is carried
as alternatives); the Q5 residual (which recorded hours DD-120/RM-530 count; HC-630 per count or per BHA run) is
computed under every reading. Every result's remaining alternatives name their condition and owning gate.
