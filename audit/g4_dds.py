"""G4 drilling (DDS-2025-118): chronology and shared state across invoices.

Consumes the G2 world and the G3 drilling line results (closed, never modified) and applies:
1. once only (Cl.29 p7 'No service is charged twice for the same well and the same day, save that item PD-210 may be
   charged more than once on a day for different depth intervals'; Cl.26 once per BHA run, DD-111 on the run's last day
   and LW-420 on its first; Cl.27 once per well, MB-701/DD-140 on the first day on the well and MB-702/LW-430 on the
   last, LW-430 only where logging while drilling was run; Cl.31 a loss charged as one unit on the day of the loss):
   of the charges of one service for one well-day, run, well or loss, one stands. The contract does not say which of
   two admissible charges is the one that stands (CW Cl.44's later-copy rule is not imported: Q7 C), so where two or
   more could, each is carried as an alternative ('stands'); a charge the contract does not allow on its day never
   stands. The first and last days on a well are the first and last days its Daily Drilling Reports cover (one report
   per well and day, Sch 5 p24; rig-move days are not days on the well, P4 p11).
2. daily limits (Cl.22 p6; Sch 3 Part 5 pp21-22), per well-day (D6), on the charge that stands.
3. annual footage (Sch 2 Part 2 p17; 3A p35): PD-210's rate is taken at 100/96/92% by the metres already drilled on the
   well in the Contract Year; an interval crossing 40,000 or 120,000 m is divided. Open: which metres count (Q11: the
   PD-210 metres charged, or every metre drilled on the well) and whether the Contract Year restarts on 1 January 2026
   (Q14); every reading is computed.
4. the A3 retrospective difference (A3 p42; 36A p35; SoV p37) on protected services already invoiced, and its single
   recipient under Q1 (36A 'on or after' / A3 'after', contract-wide; C: each well's own first invoice).
DS-900, VAT and invoice totals are G5's.

       same metres are charged once. The intervals of one well-day are cut at every boundary into elementary segments;
       a segment covered by more than one admissible charge is contested and belongs to exactly one of them. Which one
       is not stated (Q7 C; G5 applies the owner's earlier-invoice rule): every assignment of every contested segment

    2. Annual footage (Sch 2 Part 2 p17; 3A p35). The metres already drilled in the Contract Year are counted over
       UNIQUE metres: under Q11 A the union of the admissible PD-210 intervals (a contested segment once, whoever keeps

       not established stays a possible earlier contributor (a range, never omitted); a price that depends on it is

    3. Valuation. A charge's value in a scenario is the sum, over the segments it keeps, of each depth-band piece at the
