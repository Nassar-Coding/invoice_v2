"""G5: one outcome per invoice (flag, category, expected judged total, confidence) from the G3 line results and the G4
state, under the decisions of spec/g5_decisions.yaml.

For every template invoice G5 assembles its lines (the G4-valued copies of the G3 results, never modified), fixes the
readings decided from source or by the owner, tests the invoice's own statements of facts assigned to documents not
supplied (Q9-3), and enumerates the readings still open (Q9-2) as scenarios. In each scenario the invoice is evaluated
check by check: every line's contract value against its billed value and its established findings, the header
arithmetic, the judged total (civil: sum of line amounts; drilling: services, DS-900, net, VAT, total - Cl.36-40), the
procedural checks, and the payment-only duties the contract gives this invoice (the A3 adjustment on its recipient,
the 45A release). The flag, category, expected total and confidence follow Q9-1..6. Nothing here reprices a line: G3
priced it under every admissible input and G4 applied the state; G5 selects and combines.
